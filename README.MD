This sctipt is based on the task on file system from Zuri, Node Js Track. 
It involvs getting json data from a url and then saving the data to file and afterwards pushing to Github
THe fileWrite operation is done inside the fetch operation. Im not sure if this is the best way to go about it, but i understand that both operations can be broken down into two seperate operations. 

But since the script is relatively small, Ill just go with this method.
